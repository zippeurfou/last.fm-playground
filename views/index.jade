  h2 This is really a quick website to be able to access all tags and artists
  h3 Welcome to #{title}
  p.
   I hope you will enjoy the website.
   There are different things here. You have an API under /api. This is really a basic API coded kinda quickly.. Well it's kinda a bonus I guess.  
  p.
   The format is as follow 
   <strong>baseurl/api/:method/:object/:field?/:limit?</strong> where 
   <strong>method</strong>
   is in <i>["rank","get","list"]</i>, 
   <strong>object</strong>
   is in <i>["tag","artist"]</i> <strong>field</strong> is the field you want to see in the database 
   (i.e. <i>name</i>) if there is nothing it will ignore it and return the whole object.
   <strong>limit</strong> is the number of result you want to have.
   When you use rank you will need to use <i><strong>-</strong>field</i> if you want it decreasing.
   If you use <strong>get</strong> you need to put a field.
  code.  
       i.e. <a href="api/rank/tag/-apiSimilarity">baseurl/api/rank/tag/-apiSimilarity</a> will give you the my closest similarities tags with the last.fm api
       i.e. <a href="api/get/tag/electro">baseurl/api/get/tag/electro</a> will give you the electro tag
       i.e. <a href="api/get/artist/Coldplay">baseurl/api/get/artist/Coldplay</a> will give you Coldplay
       i.e. <a href="api/list/tag/name">baseurl/api/list/tag/name</a> will give you all the tags names
       i.e. <a href="api/rank/artist/-listeners/4">baseurl/api/rank/artist/-listeners/4</a> will give you the 4 artist the most listenned to.
  p.
   Ok It's basic but more will come.. Lastly, If you are on chrome I highly advise you to use the JSON Formatter extension.
   It will make your life easier to read JSON files.
   Is That all? Well kinda, I am working on doing some graphs you should see them here when it's done==>> 
   <a href="charts">baseurl/charts</a>
